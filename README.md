# VideoStage


Setup

Install FBI on your system, not Federal... but like the framebuffer thing, and check that it works. Use this as a guide. https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/fbi.1.html

Then just go

```
cat /dev/fb0 > /home/pi/1.fb
```
and change the '1' to be whichever scene number you want it to be. 

I'll write some more documentation sometime.
